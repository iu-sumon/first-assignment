                A term that represents the fact that, via the Internet, we can be connected to others across the globe
                and feel we are part of a collective community Connecting to the global community fosters education,
                collaboration, and the birth of mutually-beneficial programs that make an impact. On the micro level,
                keeping oneself connected to the global community requires a conscious decision.
